# Variables and Simple Data Types
- Variables are boxes you can store data in.

- print(name.title())
    - title() is a method
- A method is an action Python can perform on a piece of data.
    - The dot (.) after name tells python to make the title() method act on the variable 'name'.
- Methods are followed by parantheses () because they often need additional information to do their work.
